## Facial recognition using Microsoft's Cognitive Services
Hello.  This code is the result of my tinkering with: 
Quickstart: Use the Face client library - Azure Cognitive Services | Microsoft Docs
which is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Face/Quickstarts/client-libraries?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=visual-studio)
<br/>While the Quickstart uses images on the internet, method gipsImageStream uses images local to your machine.  It draws face rectangle(s) on the image file and stores it in the outputImages directory.  The inputImages directory contains images I found quickly on the internet that I thought had decent facial expressions.<br/>
Method gipsImageUrl uses some LINQ lambda expression razzmatazz :smiley:.
