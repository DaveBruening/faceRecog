## Facial recognition using Microsoft's Cognitive Services
Hello.  This code is the result of my tinkering with: 
Quickstart: Use the Face client library - Azure Cognitive Services | Microsoft Docs
which is located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Face/Quickstarts/client-libraries?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=visual-studio)
<br/>Method gipsImageStream draws face rectangle(s) on the image file and stores it in the outputImages directory.  The inputImages directory contains images I found quickly on the internet.
